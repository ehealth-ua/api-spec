# eHealth MIS API

This is a **MIS-related consumers  part** of API documentation for Ukrainian Health Services government institution back-end, that should provide:

* Master Patients Index (MPI)
* Global Medical Institutions and Doctors Registries
* Partnership Relation Management (PRM) module that describes business relations between this 3 entities.


This API design in based on [Nebo #15 API Design Manifest](http://docs.apimanifest.apiary.io/).

## Context Switching for end-users

Since Doctor may have multiple work-places, you MUST fetch list of possible work-contexts and apply `legal_entity_id` filter on each request, where this parameter is available.

Thus you will make sure that end-user understand from which context entities are managed.

If our API returns only one work context, you are free to hide context picker.

## Submitting Issues

To submit issues you should use [Issue Tracking Repo](https://github.com/ehealth-ua/api-spec), issues in all other repositories are used to plan backlog and non-related issued will be closed.

##oAuth [/api/oauth]

1. Client UI: redirects user to Login UI with `client_id`, `redirect_uri` and `response_type=code` query params;
2. Login UI: completes [Session]() auth flow with `apps:create` scope;
3. Login UI: renders page with Approval (which lists requested scopes);
4. User: approves scopes;
5. Login UI: sends `POST /apps` request and redirects user to location returned in `Location` header;
6. Client: exchanges `code` from query parameters to an `access_token` by sending `POST /tokens` request with `grant_type=authorization_code`.
7. Client Back-End: stores `refresh_token` (in back-end!) and sends `access_token` to Client UI;
8. Client UI: stores `access_token` (in local storage, cookie, etc.) and makes all future requests with `Auhtorization: Bearer <access_token>` header.

**Notes:**
- If User already has approval with insufficient scopes, all steps are required, but Login UI MAY render page that shows only newly added scopes.
- When `access_token` expires, Client repeats steps 6-8 but via `grant_type=refresh_token`.

**API-key:**
- For identifiers MIS clients (as a brocker) we use term API-key. MIS must be **mandatory** send API-key when called e-Health API.
- API-key its a `client_secret` - Medical Information System secret key issued upon integration request.
- API-key dispatched in Request HEADER as a `API-key` attribute. Example:
```
HEADERS
Content-Type:application/json
Authorization:Bearer c2778f3064753ea70de870a53795f5c9
API-key:uXhEczJ56adsfh3Ri9SUkc4en
```
- If MIS don't send API-key in Request HEADER, API return 401 error wih message "API-KEY header required".

You MUST redirect your users to this URL to obtain oAuth Code Grant (which is later exchanged to Access Token).

User will see rendered login page, which structure differ by a list of requested scopes and security measures applied by DevOps team.

For security purposes, we will set `X-Frame-Options: deny` header that will disallow opening this page in an iframe.

    + Headers

            X-CSRF-Token: my-csrf-token

### Exchange oAuth Code Grant to Access Token [POST /oauth/tokens]

After obtaining oAuth Code Grant, it should be exchanged to an `access_token` **on your back-end**.

General recommendations:

- Never expose `client_secret` to your front-end.
- Also we recommend to avoid pushing it to the application source code, to limit number of developers that have access to it.

Exposed client credentials may be blocked for a security reasons, you will need to contact administrator to receive a new credentials.

## Person Requests [/api/person_requests]
[Person Request]() is a life-cycle entity that is used to create person WITHOUT [Declarations]().


### Create/Update Person Request [POST /api/person_requests]

This method is used to create Person Request (as part of Person creation w/o declaration process).
Upon successful completion of the whole process, a person is created in MPI.


**NOTE:** Also this method allows you to update the person’s data according to his id, which was previously found.
A block with information about authentication methods must be transferred when the person is created. But it is prohibited to transfer it when updating the person.

This table shows which fields are required for specific action:

Actions   | person.id     | person.authentication_methods
----------|---------------|--------------------
**Create**    |      -        | required
**Update**    | required      |     -

      

There are three methods of authentication - OTP, OFFLINE and the THIRD_PERSON. A person > 14 years  can have OTP or OFFLINE.
A person < 14 years can only have authentication method =  third person.

This method is used to sign Person Request. Method receives signed message (pkcs7) including signed content, digital signature and signer public key in `signed_content` property.
All signature fields will be validated (including signer certificate authority).

This service will store signed copy of Person Request in Media Content Storage, created or update MPI records  if signature is all checks is passed.

Signed content MUST consists of JSON object with Person Request data and printout template. Object that need to be signed is returned by `Get Person request by ID` or `Approve Person request` response, `JSON.Path: $.data`.
Person must re-read and sign person request print form and after that `patient_signed` should be changed to TRUE.

Person request can be signed either by doctor or admin (user with scope `person_request:write`) from legal entity as in person request.

This method is used to create Declaration Request (as part of Declaration creation process) via new api. New version changes person search and adds new fields to request.

This service will store signed copy of Declaration Request in Media Content Storage, create declaration if signature is all checks is passed.

Signed content MUST consists of JSON object with Declaration Request data from field `data_to_be_signed`. Object that need to be signed is returned by `Get Declaration request by ID` or `Approve declaration request` response, `JSON.Path: $.data.data_to_be_signed`.
Patient must re-read and sign declaration print form and after that `patient_signed` should be changed to TRUE.

Declaration request can be signed either by doctor or admin (user with scope `declaration_request:sign`) from legal entity as in declaration request.

**Important**
Invoke Get Declaration Request by ID to obtain seed - Hash of previous block in declarations chain or other random component that should be signed with declaration.

There is a [**dummy method**](https://uaehealthapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/dummy-methods/dummy-for-declaration-request/sign-declaration-request) that describes the signed date example.

### Create/Update Legal Entity V2 [PUT /api/v2/legal_entities]

Key features and main differences from V1:

* *legal entity types and licenses are created/updated one by one, i.e. one legal entity type and one license are accepted in one call*

* *medical_services_providers structure is removed, accreditation and license parameters are moved to the root*

* *added EDR integration in order to validate and enrich legal entity data*

* *it can be also used to update owner data. In this case `employee_id` should be passed in the payload in the owner block*

User may accept or decline Invitation.

For changes to take effect employee must confirm the changes.

There is a [**dummy method Create/Update legal entity V2**](https://uaehealthapi.docs.apiary.io/#reference/dummy-methods/dummy-for-legal-entity/create/update-legal-entity-v2) that describes the latest legal entity data model and can be used as documentation.

# Group Public. Contracts

Note: In the new version of API contracts(relese TBD) will be divided into two types - capitation and reimbursement. Each type will be managed by its own route. The type of the contract should be declared in the URL like this:
```
/api/contract_requests/capitation
/api/contract_requests/reimbursement
```
If contract_type is not defined in the URL it counts as a capitation contract.

## Contract request [/api/contract_requests]

###Business logic
In order to create a new contract or update an existing contract, legal entity owner should create a contract request first. The contract request should be approved by both sides - Medical Service Provider(MSP) and National Health Service(NHS), and than signed by both sides as well. After that a new contract will be created or an existing contract will be updated.
The detailed flow is described in a schema below:
